* ideally add a never allow mechanism for execmod and ptrace
    access is governed through macro's but there is no neverallow rule enforcing the use of them, too complicated

* (roletype sys.r sys_object_type) in sys.cil is not optimal
    ideally "usersubject_object_type" (which would be associated with all usersubject object types) would be excluded because
    system generally has no business with user objects. This will not fly though because for example /run/UID/systemd is created
    with sys.u:sys.r:...

    took care of /run/UID/systemd by associating sys.r with systemd.user_tmpfs_object, so unless there are anymore of these exceptions,
    i should be able to make this work

* the priv_user_login and ssh_priv_user_login booleans are empty
    login programs are allowed to manual subject type transition to all login user subjects on shell files
    differentiate between priv and unpriv login users and make priv user login conditional

    took care of priv_user_login and ssh_priv_user_login: need to test it

* there are a lot of redundant (context ...) statements that could be removed (low priority)
    the question is which ones to remove without being inconsistent, some are easier than others

    There is a bug in secilc that prevents me from declaring contexts in blockbstracts if they are inherited on more than a single level

* implement environ etc file type to differentiate between config and environ files. this will enable me to allow systemd to read all environ files, and only
    select etc files without things becoming high maintenance.

* cover runuser as its setuid and maintains pam config. maybe it makes sense to run this label it sudo_exec_t (akmods runs runuser)

* confined users arent allowed to manage session units because the systemd session daemon currently runs with the systemd system daemons' credentials
