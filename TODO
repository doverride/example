* ideally add a never allow mechanism for execmod and ptrace
    access is governed trough macro's but there is no neverallow rule enforcing the use of them, too complicated

* investigate feasibility of reimplementation of admin_pattern() using classmapping

* systemd daemon executable files get associated with bin_type two times, once through subject_entry() in systemd_daemon_subject_entry()
    and once though systemd bin_object blockinherit included with systemd_daemon blockabstract
