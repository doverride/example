* ideally add a never allow mechanism for execmod and ptrace
    access is governed through macro's but there is no neverallow rule enforcing the use of them, too complicated

* (roletype sys.r sys_object_type) in sys.cil is not optimal
    ideally "usersubject_object_type" (which would be associated with all usersubject object types) would be excluded because
    system generally has no business with user objects. This will not fly though because for example /run/UID/systemd is created
    with sys.u:sys.r:...

    took care of /run/UID/systemd by associating sys.r with systemd.user_tmpfs_object, so unless there are anymore of these exceptions,
    i should be able to make this work

* the priv_user_login and ssh_priv_user_login booleans are empty
    login programs are allowed to manual subject type transition to all login user subjects on shell files
    differentiate between priv and unpriv login users and make priv user login conditional
